This workshop will provide a background and introduction to Bayesian analysis using Stan and R interfaces to Stan. We will then work through 1-2 example applications in the area of cancer genomics.

[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a modern probabilistic programming language implementing full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling (NUTS, HMC), approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference (ADVI), and penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization (L-BFGS).

Potential applications include:

* A model for mutation signature detection (cancer genomics)
* A clonality deconvolution model (cancer genomics)
* Evaluating (predictive) biomarkers for response to treatment (cancer genomics)
* Analysis of RNA expression data (genomics)
* Gene set enrichment analysis (genomics)

Users should be familiar with basic probability theory and statistical methods. Prior experience with R is essential. Knowledge of genomic data and cancer biology will help but is not at all required.

Following this workshop users will have a basic familiarity with Stan and [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/rstan.html). They will be able to code simple models in Stan and be familiar with the process for specifying and fitting complex models in Stan.
